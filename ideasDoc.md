- Password Management/User Authentication ( We call dibs on this one. Sorry :(  )
    + Literature : Lot of literature found, many different ideas. But papers are not specific to the domain/conferences of software engineering; don't know if that's a problem.
        * [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=password+management)
        * [ACM](https://dl.acm.org/results.cfm?query=password+management)
    + Yes its a pretty common problem
    + Many ways to implement

- Price aggregator : present the best price of a product available online
    + Literature : found some but not specific to the implementation ways of price aggregator, go more into consumer behaviour
    + Yes its a problem, but has already many solutions online
        * CamelCamelCamel, PricePinx, Invisible hand, PriceGrabber
        * [More](https://alternativeto.net/software/camelcamelcamel/)
    + ways to implement: (can't think of many) extension/webapp, crawl webpage/fetch from other price aggregator?
- Health management : assists user based on health preferences and more?
    + Adequate literature found 
    + It may be a common problem, but don't know if people will trust an application with their health
    + Ways to implement: Not many obvious ways that are different
- Community crowdsourcing (refining the idea) : 
    + Ride sharing 
    + Grocery delivery
    + community issues - help wanted - volunteer
    + earn credits that you can spend later
        * promotes volunteering and helping, local interaction
    + renting things/garage sale?
    + ways to implement
        * sms system?
        * website?
        * app?
    + [Literature](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=crowdsourcing+application&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C34),[More](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=i9ieBQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA50&dq=crowdsourcing&ots=90FGbJhbHJ&sig=D8USF9kjc4VgZD3MqTCmA_kqfrQ#v=onepage&q=crowdsourcing&f=false)
- Displaying and Aggregating crime statistics in local area/city (refining the idea)
    + display a heat map of crime
    + is it safe to go out today?
    + user reporting of incidents

 3 Ways:
  a. Crowdsourcing for news reports. Paticipants: “You have agreed to act as a reader reporter. You have given permission to the newsroom to locate your mobile phone. Based on location, mobile assignments asking to capture multimedia or for reporting can be sent to your mobile phone, for example if there is a fire close to you.”
  b. Geo-taging for content
  c. Hand out assignment via SMS (“According to the newsroom’s information, you are close to the central park. Please take a photo of a typical tree in the cityscape and upload it. Use OKReportteri for capturing and uploading.” (a photo task))
  

- Meeting new people in gym/sports/activity based on location
Literature from Google Scholar:
  Couldn't find 3+ ways to conduct the solution, as there aren't woo many paper regarding this issue. Need input.
  
  
- Repo of dangerous areas, incidents, thefts - crowdsourced?
Possible resemblance to what's been found on News aggregator
  
  
- File organizers /Download manager
    - categorize into music/videos/docs
    - provide more utility features?

    
- Backup management
Protecting File Systems: A Survey of Backup Techniques http://www.storageconference.us/1998/papers/a1-2-CHERVE.pdf
    - automatic backup?
    - manual
    - other techniques
There're several backup method we can impliment, such as incremental backup where we only add new files and modified files into the new backup, full backup as we backup all of the files during the backup procudure, we can choose local backup and online backup as well. We can conduct survey on how people conduct their backup and how often do they backup their files.

- Renting Application/Sale Application: (Facebook/Craigslist do a pretty good enough job i think...)

- Indian store visits:   
	- people with cars can advertise when they are going to indian store and how many more can they accomodate.
	- a person rents a car and advertises 'there is room for x people'
	- a one-time visit to indian store costs about $40 by Uber (to and fro). This cost could be saved.
	- Crowd-pool 'indian store visit' to reduce costs. ( people from 4 different apartments book a single uber, so effectively the cost is reduced by 4 times).  
		  
	Ways to execute the solution:
	-consumer-subscriber model
	-normal crowd-sourcing (common uber)

- Personal journal, diary input methods:
	-write by hand and take a pic
	-actually tell about stuff
	-type it in
