### Using Voice as Authentication:

[Speaker Recognition API by Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/speaker-recognition-api)

[VoiceIt](https://siv.voiceprintportal.com/)

[VoiceVault](http://voicevault.com/support/voice-biometric-tutorials-and-howtos/)

[recognito](https://github.com/amaurycrickx/recognito)

[Modular Audio Recognition Framework](http://marf.sourceforge.net/)

### Gaits as Authentication

Don't think there's any, we might have to do the analysis on our own

### Type Pattern as Authentication

[Typingdna](http://typingdna.com/)  
This can be used for web-based logins.Not really sure whether it would ID correctly for mobile logins.

### Finger Print as Authentication

[Android API](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/marshmallow/android-6.0.html#fingerprint-authentication)
[iOS API](https://developer.apple.com/reference/localauthentication) This is for local authentication, also there's for the KeyChain system, sample code can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/KeychainTouchID/Introduction/Intro.html)

### Heart-beat as Authentication

Using 'only' heart-beat as a biometric does not make sense. The literature found talks about ECG pattern of each person being unique.  
Didn't find any relevant API that does this out-of-the-box.

### Face as Authentication

Most of the products out there, merely provide face 'recognition' as opposed to 'IDing' a person using face.
Also face-recognition locks have a quite poor results ( a friend of mine had it on a tab and he almost never got it unlocked via the face-recognition thing).
