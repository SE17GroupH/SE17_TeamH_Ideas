#### A Password Manager that Doesn't Remember Passwords
Abstract:  
The problems with passwords are well-known: secure passwords are difficult to remember, users have too many passwords, and users have difficulty matching their passwords to accounts. Password managers and cued graphical passwords are two password solutions that address the issues of memorability and keeping track of of passwords. We have developed Versipass, a password manager that incorporates key elements of password managers and cued graphical passwords to avoid existing problems of password memorability and associating passwords with accounts. Instead of remembering passwords, Versipass remembers image cues for graphical passwords. These cues help users to better remember their passwords and to more easily link passwords with accounts. Versipass also facilitates safe password reuse by allowing users to use the same image cue for multiple accounts.

#### Passpet: convenient password management and phishing protection
Abstract:  
We describe Passpet, a tool that improves both the convenience and security of website logins through a combination of techniques. Password hashing helps users manage multiple accounts by turning a single memorized password into a different password for each account. User-assigned site labels (petnames) help users securely identify sites in the face of determined attempts at impersonation (phishing). Password-strengthening measures defend against dictionary attacks. Customizing the user interface defends against user-interface spoofing attacks. We propose new improvements to these techniques, discuss how they are integrated into a single tool, and compare Passpet to other solutions for managing passwords and preventing phishing.

#### Tapas: design, implementation, and usability evaluation of a password manager
Abstract:  
Passwords continue to prevail on the web as the primary method for user authentication despite their well-known security and usability drawbacks. Password managers offer some improvement without requiring server-side changes. In this paper, we evaluate the security of dual-possession authentication, an authentication approach offering encrypted storage of passwords and theft-resistance without the use of a master password. We further introduce Tapas, a concrete implementation of dual-possession authentication leveraging a desktop computer and a smartphone. Tapas requires no server-side changes to websites, no master password, and protects all the stored passwords in the event either the primary or secondary device (e.g., computer or phone) is stolen. To evaluate the viability of Tapas as an alternative to traditional password managers, we perform a 30 participant user study comparing Tapas to two configurations of Firefox's built-in password manager. We found users significantly preferred Tapas. We then improve Tapas by incorporating feedback from this study, and reevaluate it with an additional 10 participants.

#### UbiKiMa: ubiquitous authentication using a smartphone, migrating from passwords to strong cryptography
Abstract:  
Passwords are the only ubiquitous form of authentication currently available on the web. Unfortunately, passwords are insecure. In this paper we therefore propose the use of strong cryptography, using the fact that users increasingly own a smartphone that can perform the required cryptographic operations on their behalf. This is not as trivial as it sounds. Services will not migrate to new forms of authentication if few users have the means to use it. Similarly, users will not acquire the means if there are few services that accept them. Moreover, enabling one's smartphone to seamlessly sign in at a website when browsing on an arbitrary PC is non-trivial.  

We propose a system, based on a smartphone app, that can be used to sign in with username and password to arbitrary websites using an arbitrary PC or laptop. We describe the protocol and implementation to achieve this without the need for typing usernames and passwords. Furthermore, we propose an authentication protocol based on public key cryptography, integrated in the same smartphone app. This allows websites to seamlessly migrate towards a much more secure authentication method on the web, independently of each other. A prototype of our system has been developed.
